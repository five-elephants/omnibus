OMNIBUS on-chip bus
-------------------

OMNIBUS is a simple, pipelined bus written in SystemVerilog. It is based on
the Open Core Protocol (OCP) specification. Request and response channels are
independent and have individual handshakes. This allows to start a new request
in every cycle and allows for arbitrary latency of attached slaves. The bus
fabric is constructed from three basic building blocks for arbitration of
masters, multiplexing to slaves, and pipelining of requests and responses.

To ease the description of the fabric in the HDL code, a domain-specific
language (DSL) implemented with M4 macros can be used. However, this is
optional. Using the DSL, bus fabric description looks like this:

  include(bus.m4)

  bus_begin(testbus, clk, <:.byteen(1):>)
    master(bus_master_a) 
    master(bus_master_b)
    master(bus_master_c) arb arb
        delay
        split(29)
          split(28)
            slave(0)
            slave(1)
          split(28)
            delay slave(2_d2)
            slave(3)
  bus_end()


The bus fabric was initially developed in the course of a PhD thesis.
Additional information and a detailed description of the building blocks is
therefore available in the Dissertation of Simon Friedmann in the doc/
directory.
